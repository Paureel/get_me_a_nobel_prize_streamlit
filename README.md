# Get Me A Nobel Prize - powered by LLMs
 A streamlined interface built on Streamlit that interacts with the GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 models (custom models coming soon!) from OpenAI to generate scientific hypotheses. Users can input their scientific problems or the output of their machine learning algorithm of choice to generate potential solutions and visualizations. The visualization is powered by UMAP, and is used to visualize the one-sentence embeddings of the generated hypotheses, where semanticaly similar hypotheses are going to be closer together.

 The app can be accessed here: https://getmeanobelprize.streamlit.app/
 
 ## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models.
- **Visualization**: UMAP-based scatter plot of one-sentence embeddings of the generated hypotheses.
- **AI Chat**: Chat with the model, view history, and download the chat history.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key
- UMAP
- Plotly

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Paureel/get_me_a_nobel_prize_streamlit
   ```
2. **Navigate**:
	```sh
	cd get_me_a_nobel_prize_streamlit
	```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
	```sh
	conda create --name envname --file requirements.txt
	```
4. **Run**:
	```sh
	streamlit run app.py
	```
	
## Todos

- [] Add custom prompts (the one I'm using is hardcoded)
- [] Ability to download the embedding vectors
- [] Add custom models instead of OpenAI models
- [] More examples
